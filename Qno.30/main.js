/*Hello Admin:
Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website.
Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.*/
var user = ["Admin", "Sara", "Saad", "user2", "user4"];
if (user.includes("Admin")) {
    console.log("Hello Admin, would you like to see a status report?");
}
if (user.includes("Sara")) {
    console.log("Hello Sara, thank you for logging again.");
}
if (user.includes("Saad")) {
    console.log("Hello Saad, thank you for logging again.");
}
if (user.includes("user2")) {
    console.log("Hello user2, thank you for logging again.");
}
if (user.includes("user4")) {
    console.log("Hello user4, thank you for logging again.");
