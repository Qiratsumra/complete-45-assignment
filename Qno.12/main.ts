/*Greetings:
Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same,
but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/

let names:string[]=["Duaa","Zainab","Reja","Areeba","Ayesha"];
names.forEach(name=>console.log(`Hello ${name} how are you?`)
);
